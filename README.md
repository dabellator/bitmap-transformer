This app will transform a bitmap image file by changing the colors.

Run the file with "node index.js" (or run it form the command line with ./index.js) followed by the name of the bitmap file to edit as the first command line argument. **The file must be in the img directory already!**

Give a filename for the second argument. *The new file created will be saved to the img directory*

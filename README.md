This app will transform a bitmap image file by changing the colors.

Run the file with "node index.js" (or run it form the command line with ./index.js) followed by the name of the bitmap file to edit as the first command line argument. **The file must be in the img directory already! Otherwise, specify a relative path from the img directory.** E.g ../orignal.bmp would find original.bmp in the same directory as index.js.

Give a filename for the second argument. *The new file created will be saved to the img directory by default. Specify a relative path from there to save elsewhere. E.g. ../transformed.bmp  would save transfomred.bmp in the same directory as index.js*
